## why build this mehran ?

A software engineer who, by combining it with medical engineering, is going to do relatively big things.

This website is not intended to be a training course or to teach anything.
Here we are going to learn the intersection of science and art and their integration.

I am a bachelor of medical engineering.
I try to prepare at least some content for this website every day. Blog topics are mostly about programming and system work, but I don't guarantee that we will stay on the same topic. It is possible to put anything wherever I think is right.


Using the source of this website is completely free and it is free to use in any way, both commercial and free.

Topics:

- Software Application (C++, JS, Python & Other Technology)
- Art & Music (Renessiance Art)
- Mathmatics & Algorithm
- Physics & Galaxy
- Learning English Lang
